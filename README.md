# Data Visualization Project

## Data
The data I propose to visualize for my project is COVID Patient Cases data in May2020. 
The original data was taken from Kaggle: Corona virus cases. It has covid patient count, death counts reported all over the world. For the visualization purpose this data is filtered only for month of May.
This data is available on my gist [World corona virus cases May2020](https://gist.github.com/manasishrotri/4e43a48d4a8c89f011dbf18b7de28190)


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. 
I have created a line chart of covis cases along Y axis and Date as X axis
With this screenshot, we can see new patient cases of United states are going down while for Brazil they are increasing

### Prototype graph 1

### Prototype graph 2

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which countries were more affected worldwide?
 * In which countries patient count is decreasing and for which countries it is increasing?
 * Which countries have more variation in total cases
 * Which days had highest count of patient deaths
 * Display daywise spread continentwise
 
 
## Sketches

* Graph1 is line chart showing Total cases in a month of May. This answers two questions, 
   Which countries were more affected worldwide?
   In which countries patient count is decreasing and for which countries it is increasing?
* Graph 2 is box plot of Total cases showing variation and median of in total cases in a month for all countries.
* Graph 3 is bar chart for comapring spread of virus on 1st day and on 31 st day
* Graph 4 is bubble chart which shows country wise data


## Open Questions

* For the prototype graph 2 which relates to the question, show the ranking of countries on 1st day vs on the 31st May or how ranking and cases changed from start of the month till end of the month, I am not sure if I am able to convey that through my visualization. 
* Also I would like to implement box plot with D3 React

## Interactions

* Using drop down for selecting countries, for a line chart
* For world map, use tooltip to show count and country name

## Schedule of Deliverables

Week 1:
* Read data using D3 and react 
* Plot line graph

Week 2: 
* Prepare data for Box plot
* Understand how to create world map with size of data as bubbles

Week 3: 
* Complete box plot
* Add iteraction for line chart as drop down option for countries

Week 4:
* Work on World map
* Create bar chart with React &  D3

Week 5:
* Complete world chart 
* Complete project report
